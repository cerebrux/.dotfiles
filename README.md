# .dotfiles

Git Bare repository with my dotfiles for :

* NeoVim
* Alacritty and Kitty terminals

Also the installer will download and configure:

* Oh my Tmux config
* SlimZsh 

## How to download

### Step 1: Dependencies 

First install the following dependencies:

* Fira Code fonts : We need Ligatures for icons and symbols
* NeoVim : Because that is what I use
* git : This is for downliading the repository
* nodejs : Is used by the CoC Plugin
* npm : Is used by the CoC Plugin
* tmux : Because why use regular shell session when you can tmux ?
* zsh : Bash is for Boomers
* shellcheck : Is used by Neomake plugin to check your shell scripts

For Ubunut/Debian and derivatives you can install the dependencies by running:

```
sudo apt install fonts-firacode git nodejs npm tmux zsh shellcheck
sudo apt install snapd
sudo snap install nvim --beta --classic
```

### Step 2: Run the installer

Then run the following:
```
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cerebrux/.dotfiles/master/.clone-dotfiles.sh | bash
```

The script will create te environment, backup your old dotfiles and then clone this repo.

### Step 3: Test the environment

Now run nvim and check if coc.nvim starts updating the plugins. 
Once it's done, run ":checkhealth" command in neovim to make sure that it's properly setup
