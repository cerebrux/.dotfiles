# .dotfiles

Git Bare repository with my dotfiles for :

* NeoVim
* Alacritty and Kitty terminals

Also the installer will download and configure:

* Oh my Tmux config
* SlimZsh 

## How to download

### Step 1: Dependencies 

First install the following dependencies:

* Fira Code fonts : We need Ligatures for icons and symbols
* NeoVim : Because that is what I use
* git : This is for downloading the repository
* nodejs : Is used by the CoC Plugin
* npm : Is used by the CoC Plugin
* tmux : Because why use regular shell session when you can tmux ?
* zsh : Bash is for Boomers
* shellcheck : Is used by Neomake plugin to check your shell scripts
* Jump : It learns from you by keeping track of the directories you visit.

For Ubunut/Debian and officially supported derivatives you can install the dependencies by running:

```
sudo apt install fonts-firacode curl git nodejs npm tmux zsh shellcheck kitty
wget https://github.com/gsamokovarov/jump/releases/download/v0.30.1/jump_0.30.1_amd64.deb && sudo apt install ./jump_0.30.1_amd64.deb
sudo apt install snapd
sudo snap install nvim --beta --classic
sudo snap install go --classic
chsh -s /bin/zsh 
```

### Step 2: Run the installer

Then run the following:
```
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cerebrux/.dotfiles/master/.clone-dotfiles.sh | bash
```

The script will create te environment, backup your old dotfiles and then clone this repo.

### Step 3: Test the environment

Now run nvim and check if coc.nvim starts updating the plugins. 
Once it's done, run ":checkhealth" command in neovim to make sure that it's properly setup
Then configure the Language Server acording [Lang Servers Documentation](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Language-servers)
E.g for bash scripting and Golang add the following to .config/coc/extensions/node_modules/coc-go/.vim/coc-settings.json

```
  "languageserver": {
    "bash": {
      "command": "bash-language-server",
      "args": ["start"],
      "filetypes": ["sh"],
      "ignoredRootPaths": ["~"]
    },
    "golang": {
      "command": "gopls",
      "rootPatterns": ["go.mod"],
      "disableWorkspaceFolders": true,
      "filetypes": ["go"]
    }
  }
```
